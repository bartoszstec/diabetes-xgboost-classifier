# 🩺 Clinical Relevance:
- Model prioritizes sensitivity - minimizes false negatives (missed diabetes cases)
- Good trade-off between identifying diabetic patients and avoiding false alarms
- Suitable for screening where catching potential cases is crucial


# 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid Search

## Preprocessing Pipeline
- Data normalization
- Handling of data leakage cases
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
- Patient phenotype clustering (K-means)
- Feature encoding (gender representation tested with both Label and One-Hot Encoding)

# 📈 Performance & Results
## Performance
|               Metric               |      Overall      | Class 0 (No Diabetes)  | Class 1 (Diabetes) |
|:----------------------------------:|:-----------------:|:---:| :---: |
|            **Accuracy**            |     **81.08%**      | - | - |
|           **Precision**            | **82.50% (weighted)** |   **89.65%**   | **69.50%** |
|             **Recall**             | **81.08% (weighted)** |   **79.90%**   | **83.23%** |
|            **F1-Score**            | **81.39% (weighted)** |   **84.49%**   | **75.75%** |
|       **Support (samples)**        |     941 total     |   607   | 334 |

## Key Insights:
- High recall for diabetic class (83.23%) - model effectively identifies patients with diabetes
- High precision for non-diabetic class (89.65%) - when predicting "no diabetes", it's usually correct
- Balanced performance with weighted F1-score of 81.39%
- Clustering improved recall for the positive class compared to baseline models

## Feature Analysis:
This section shows the relative importance of each input feature in the trained model, calculated using the *gain* metric.

Gain measures how much each feature contributes to improving the model’s predictions when it is used in a split inside the model.

![Feature importance](github_assets/Feature_importance_gain.png)

Higher values mean that the feature provides more predictive power to the model.

## Clusters PCA
This plot shows a 2-dimensional visualization of patient clusters created using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

The model first groups patients based on similarity of their medical profiles (unsupervised clustering).
PCA then compresses the high-dimensional data into two dimensions so it can be visualized.

![PCA](github_assets/PCA.png)

Each point represents one patient:
- Points close together → patients with similar medical profiles
- Points far apart → significantly different profiles
- Colors (clusters) show distinct patient subgroups

# Conclusions from the project:
- In medical classification tasks such as diabetes prediction, overall accuracy is not the most important evaluation metric. A balanced trade-off between precision and recall for each class is crucial, with particular emphasis on recall for the positive class (ill patients). Misclassifying an ill patient as healthy (false negative) is the most critical error, therefore the model should prioritize achieving a high recall for the positive class.
- The use of Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding for the binary Gender feature did not affect the model’s performance. This behavior is consistent with the properties of tree-based algorithms such as XGBoost, which are insensitive to monotonic transformations of categorical variables. Feature importance analysis further confirmed that gender has only a marginal predictive contribution compared to clinical and biometric features.
- Exploratory data analysis revealed a subset of samples containing identical constant values across multiple independent laboratory features, which resulted in perfect separation of the positive class. This pattern represents severe data leakage, where the target variable is implicitly encoded in the input features, leading to artificially inflated performance metrics. Such samples were excluded from training and evaluation to ensure realistic model behavior and proper generalization.
- Adding a phenotype-based cluster feature significantly improved recall and F1-score for the positive (diabetic) class. Interestingly, representing the cluster as an ordinal variable outperformed one-hot encoding, indicating that the discovered clusters follow a monotonic disease severity progression rather than independent categories.
